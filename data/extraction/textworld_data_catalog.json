      "Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, look and see that the antique trunk inside the bedroom is opened. Then, recover the old key from the antique trunk. Then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked. After unlocking the wooden door, open the wooden door in the bedroom. Then, try to head east. After that, try to travel south. Once you get through with that, take the milk from the couch within the living room. Having taken the milk, attempt to travel north. That done, rest the milk on the stove inside the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!",
      "Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, open the chest drawer. Then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. After picking up the old key, assure that the wooden door is unlocked. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After pulling open the wooden door, take a trip east. And then, make sure that the screen door is wide open. After that, make an effort to move east. With that done, attempt to take a trip south. Then, pick-up the carrot from the floor of the garden. And then, attempt to go to the north. If you can succeed at that, make an effort to take a trip west. And then, rest the carrot on the stove. Got that? Good!",
